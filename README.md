##I developed a Weather Application that allows users to enter a city name, fetch real-time weather information from a weather API, and display it dynamically on the webpage. The application uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for fetching and rendering the live data.

Key Features of my Weather App

City Input Search Box

The user can enter any city name into the input field.

The app dynamically sends a request to a weather API when the Get Weather button is clicked.

Real-Time Weather Data Fetch

The app uses JavaScript to send an API request (likely using fetch() method) to get the weather information.

The API responds with JSON data containing details like temperature, city name, country, and weather description.

Dynamic Data Display

The webpage updates automatically with:

City and country name (e.g., Delhi, IN)

Temperature in Celsius (e.g., 35.64Â°C)

Weather condition (e.g., overcast clouds)

No manual page refresh is required.

Clean and Simple UI

The interface is neat and user-friendly.

CSS is used to center content, style the input field and button, and make the layout visually appealing.

Tools and Technologies Used

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (or any text editor of your choice)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

API: OpenWeatherMap API or any other public weather API

Browser: Google Chrome or Firefox for testing

(Optional) Git/GitHub if version control was used
